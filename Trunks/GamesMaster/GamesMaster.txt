@
1 Galaxy Size
The size is only approximately right.
You probably want to experiment with different sizes to get
a galaxy that looks right. It should not be too crowded nor
too sparse. The size should be a multiple of ten.
@
2 Race Spacing 
The engine will make sure that distance between the
primary homeworlds are at least these light years apart.
@
3 Core Sizes 
The sizes of the homeworlds for each race.
The following would give each race 3 homeworlds of sizes
1000 250 350. The first one is the primary homeworld.
You have to define these before any of the player definitions.
@
4 Empty Planets
Within a radius [2,r] from the primary homeworld the engine
allocates a this number of empty planets, size 200 - 1,000 for the
race to colonize. 
@
5 Empty Radius
Within a radius [2,r] from the primary homeworld the engine
allocates a this number of empty planets, size 200 - 1,000 for the
race to colonize. Empty_Planets and Empty_Radius define how
many there are per race and within what radius. A number
between 4 and 10 and a radius of  race_spacing/2.0 is a
good guess.
@
6 Stuff Planets
It is possible to add a number of 'stuff' planets. These are
useless planets, all of size 200 or less, that are use to
fill up the empty space between the home worlds. They make it
possible for a players to approach (attack) other players by
different routes. The following parameter specifies how many
there are per race.
@
7 Initial tech levels
Initial tech levels can't be lower than 1. By default any Initial 
tech level less than 1 will be changed to 1.
Drive - Propulsion
Weapons - Fire power
Shields - Defense
Cargo - Transports
@
8 Full bombing
Bombed planets are completely bombed and all population,
industry, capital, colonists, and materials are gone.
Normally the population and industry is reduced to 25% of
its original value. Uncomment the next line if you want
this option.
@
9 Pax Galactica
You can enforce global peace just by putting in the number
of turns you want to disallow players to declare war
on each other. For example, Peace 20 means players cannot
declare war until turn 21. (Note that players can load cargo
at other players planets. If you do not wish to allow this
you must make it a house rule. It cannot be prevented by the
GalaxyNG server program.) Uncomment the next line if you
want this option.
@
10 Keep Production
If keep production is set, the production points spent
on the previous product are preserved, otherwise all points
are lost. Uncomment the next line if you want this option.
@
11 Don't kill off players
Don't remove idle races from a game. Normally if players do
not send in orders for a couple of turns their race self
destructs. Uncomment the next line if you want this option.
@
12 Make the Galaxy a Sphere
The galaxy can be (roughly) mapped on a sphere
This way, the gap between x (or y) coordinates of two
planets is computed with border lines crossing and
reappearing on the other side. Uncomment the next line
if you want this option.
